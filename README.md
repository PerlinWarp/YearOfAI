# YearOfAI

This repo will store some of the AI work I do as progress to my new years resolution of working on more AI. 
Alot of the AI work I do in my research cannot be shared and that is how I spend alot of the free time I have dedicated to AI, so this will be a small subset of all the AI I do in 2019. 

I am starting off with the #100DaysOfMLCode challenge.

I am also very fond of Kaggle, [here is mine](https://www.kaggle.com/perlinwarp). 

#### Day 1 - 1st of January 2019
Tried to classify CIFAR 10 using a 4 layer model in Keras. [Link to Notebook](https://github.com/PerlinWarp/YearOfAI/blob/master/CIFAR10.ipynb)

#### Day 2 - 2nd of January 2019 
Added a 6 layer model, trained it and compared accuracy between the 2 models.
