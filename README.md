# YearOfAI

This repo will store some of the AI work I do as progress to my new years resolution of working on more AI. 
Alot of the AI work I do in my research cannot be shared and that is how I spend alot of the free time I have dedicated to AI, so this will be a small subset of all the AI I do in 2019. 

I am starting off with the #100DaysOfMLCode challenge.

I am also very fond of Kaggle, [here is mine](https://www.kaggle.com/perlinwarp). 

#### Day 1 - 1st of January 2019
Tried to classify CIFAR 10 using a 4 layer model in Keras. [Link to Notebook](https://github.com/PerlinWarp/YearOfAI/blob/master/CIFAR10.ipynb)

#### Day 2 - 2nd of January 2019 
Added a 6 layer model, trained it and compared accuracy between the 2 models. 

#### Day 3 - 3rd of January 2019 
Tried to figure out why my model sucks so badly. 

#### Day 4 - 4rd of January 2019 
Made a new model and got 84.98% accuracy. 

#### Day 5 - 5th of January 2019 
Started to work on the CIFAR100 Dataset.

#### Day 6 - 6th of Janurary 2019 
Made a model for CIFAR 100 using the 100 labels, achieving validation accuracy of 57.73% but accuracy of 0.7249. 

#### Day 7 - 7th of Janurary 2019 
Playing with hyper-params and making a program for facial detection.

#### Day 8 - 8th of Janurary 2019 
Creating bounding boxes for faces from CIFAR-100 Dataset. 
[Link to Notebook](https://github.com/PerlinWarp/YearOfAI/blob/master/BoundingBoxes/BoundingBoxes.ipynb)

#### Day 9 - 9th of Janurary 2019 
Used leaky relu and managed to get 60% accuracy.
